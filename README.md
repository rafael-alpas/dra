# 🪑 Automated Real-time Sitting Posture Detection
A deep learning-based computer vision system designed to mitigate Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) by monitoring office sitting posture. This project utilizes a hybrid approach combining **YOLOv5** for person detection and **MediaPipe** for precise skeletal landmark extraction.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Monitoring:** Video stream analysis with immediate feedback.
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines object detection (YOLOv5) with pose estimation (MediaPipe) for high-fidelity coordinate tracking.
* **Optimized Classification:** Uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) optimized with **L2 Regularization** and **Batch Normalization** to prevent overfitting.
* **Actionable Feedback:** Categorizes posture into "Proper" or "Improper" with high confidence scores.

## 🏗️ Methodology
The system follows a multi-stage pipeline to ensure accuracy despite varying backgrounds or lighting:

1.  **Image Acquisition:** Captures frames from a video.
2.  **Detection & Pose Estimation:** YOLOv5 identifies the user, while MediaPipe extracts key body landmarks (focusing on the torso, shoulders, and head).
3.  **Coordinate Normalization:** Landmark data is scaled to maintain consistency regardless of the user's distance from the camera.
4.  **Classification:** A trained model processes the landmarks to determine posture quality.



## 📊 Model Performance
The model was trained on a custom-curated dataset and achieved significant stability through hyperparameter tuning:

* **Model Accuracy:** ~89.71%
* **Model Loss:** ~29.82%
